Welcome! 

This repo contains projects and tutorials that showcase how data science techniques can accelerate the biomedical sciences field. From simple statistics to advanced deep learning models can (and do!) offer tramendous advances in translational biology. I am very passionate about the use of machine learning models and other data science techniques to make inferences and predictions in this space. 

I hope you find these tutorials and project examples useful and I hope they inspire you as much as they inspire me!
